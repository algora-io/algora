# How ACME Corp Migrated 100+ Microservices to Elixir

## Company Overview

ACME Corporation is a leading e-commerce platform handling millions of transactions daily. With over 1000 employees and 10 million active users, maintaining system performance and reliability is crucial to their success.

## The Challenge

- Legacy microservices architecture built with Node.js and Python
- High infrastructure costs due to service redundancy
- Complex deployment and maintenance procedures
- Scalability issues during peak shopping seasons

## Why Elixir?

After evaluating several options, ACME chose Elixir for its:

- Excellent concurrency model
- Built-in fault tolerance
- Lower infrastructure requirements
- Strong developer productivity
- Growing ecosystem

## Implementation

The migration was completed in phases over 8 months:

1. **Planning & Training (1 month)**

   - Team training on Elixir and OTP
   - Architecture design
   - Migration strategy development

2. **Initial Migration (3 months)**

   - Core services migration
   - Development of shared libraries
   - Setup of monitoring and deployment pipelines

3. **Bulk Migration (3 months)**

   - Systematic migration of remaining services
   - Performance optimization
   - Integration testing

4. **Optimization (1 month)**
   - Fine-tuning
   - Documentation
   - Knowledge transfer

## Results

The migration to Elixir delivered impressive results:

- **300%** improvement in overall system performance
- **60%** reduction in infrastructure costs
- **90%** decrease in system failures
- **50%** reduction in deployment complexity

## Key Learnings

1. Invest in team training early
2. Migrate incrementally
3. Build strong testing practices
4. Leverage the BEAM's built-in features

## Testimonial

> "Migrating to Elixir was one of the best technical decisions we've made. The performance improvements and cost savings have been remarkable, and our team loves working with the language."
>
> â€” Sarah Chen, CTO at ACME Corp

## Tools Used

- Phoenix Framework
- Broadway for data processing
- LiveView for real-time features
- Oban for background jobs
- Commanded for event sourcing

## Looking Forward

ACME continues to expand their use of Elixir, with plans to:

- Build more real-time features with LiveView
- Implement event sourcing across all services
- Contribute back to the Elixir community
